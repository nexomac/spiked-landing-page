### 3. Follow-Up Meeting Preparation
**Updated Context:**

- Previous Meeting 3: "Key stakeholder: Michael Torres (VP Sales) - Strong advocate, mentioned 40% time savings"

**AI Recommendations Updated:**

**Realistic Sales Details:**

### 4. Simulator Feature - Objection Handling
**Updated Scenario:**
- **AI Prospect Role:** CFO - Enterprise Prospect
- **Realistic Objection:** "I appreciate the capabilities, but your Enterprise plan is $89/user/month while your competitor is $49/user. That's almost double for our 200-person sales team. How do you justify that premium?"

**Enhanced Coaching:**
- "Acknowledge their concern, then pivot to ROI and time-to-value"
- "Quantify the cost of their current inefficiencies"
- Specific frameworks: Value Selling, ROI Framework

**Professional Response Suggestions:**
1. "That's a fair question. Our customers typically see 4.5x ROI within the first quarter through time savings alone - that's 15 hours per rep per week..."
2. "Let me ask - what's the cost of a missed deal because your team didn't have the right information during a call? For most of our customers, one additional closed deal per month covers the entire year..."
